Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.
This code defines a function sum2DArray that asynchronously calculates the sum of all elements in a 2D array. 
It first checks if the input is an array. 
If valid, it uses nested loops to iterate through the array and sum all elements.
 The result is then resolved and logged. Otherwise, it rejects the promise with an error message. 
The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and handle its resolved and rejected states using Promise.
